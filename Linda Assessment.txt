Question 1.

I think it is not a question but a statement.

Question 2.

Choose either Normal Distribution, Binomial Distribution or Log normal distribution. They are used in finance. Normal distribution is continuous but binomial is descrete.
Use this link to learn more: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/probabilitydistribution.asp. You just have to say positive and negatives.

Question 3.
The code is done in Python.

import numpy as np
#This example is for Normal distribution  
mu = 0 # mean of stock prices for example
sigma = 0.1 # standard deviation of stock prices, 
s = np.random.normal(mu, sigma, 1000) # generating random data with meam mu and standard deviation sigma
print(s)

Question 4.

The risks of Bonds comes from changes in the interest rates.
The risk of equities comes from the share prices of the company that is driven by many factors including company profit/loss, nature of the business, who is the CEO, economy of SA, 
Exchange rate, is driven by imports and exports and the economy of South africa.
You can detect change by focasting the prices/interest rate/exchange rates, using historical data and stressing on the possile outcomes.

Question 5.

The budget is no longer completely random, meaning it is deterministic. The normal distribution can be used as one of the probalistic measures.

Question 6.

Value at RISK and CAPM are better metric than Standard deviation. Even though they all not satisfies the subadditive property of risk measures.
Standard deviation follows normal distrubution and data does not always follow normal distribution.

Question 7.

I will use Sharpe ratio since it tells the direction of the perfomance of the asset based on the sign of the ratio.

Question 8.

This are stochastic differential equations application questions. Just understand the form of an equations and be able to explain it application.

I honestly do not understand this question I think this will explain more about the error term of a regression line:
